## About Brand Logo
By default you see an error image in place of logo.

The GNOME logo you see in the image has not shipped with the extension.
You have to keep an svg icon with the name **brand-logo-symbolic.svg** in your `.icons` folder of home directory.
When you add the icon for the first time, you need to restart the shell or logout and login to see the change.
